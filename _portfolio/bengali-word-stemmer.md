This tool helps strip suffixes from Bengali words, simplifying them to their core form while retaining their essential meaning.

**Key Features:**
- Efficiently reduces Bengali words to their root form.
- Useful for text preprocessing in Bengali language projects.
- Enhances the accuracy of tasks like search and text classification by normalizing word forms.
