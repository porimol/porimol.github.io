Hello, I’m Porimol Chandro, an MLOps engineer with over 7 years of hands-on experience in data science, machine learning, and operations. Throughout my career, I’ve worked across different domains, but I’ve found my strengths lie in areas Deploying End to End Machine Learning Platforms. I’ve also had the chance to develop machine learning models, which has been an exciting challenge.

Currently, I’m pursuing a part-time master’s degree in Data Science and Business Analytics at the University of Warsaw, where my research focuses on predicting poverty using satellite imagery and machine learning a topic that I’m really passionate about.

One of my proudest achievements was being awarded The Best Data Engineer prize at the [Robi Datathon 2019](https://www.robi.com.bd/en/corporate/news-room/press-release/robi-organizes-the-countrys-first-ever-datathon), Bangladesh’s first and largest datathon, organized by [Robi Axiata Ltd](https://www.robi.com.bd/en), and supported by [Axiata Analytics](https://www.axiata.com/). Competing in this event, which highlighted how Big Data and Machine Learning can solve business problems, was an incredible experience, and receiving the award in the "Best Performer" category was truly an honor.

Earlier in my career, during my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to publish a research paper with IEEE on [Automated Bengali Document Summarization by Collaborating Individual Word & Sentence Scoring](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8631926).

I love exploring new ideas and technologies in machine learning and data science, whether through research or practical application, and am always excited about the potential of what’s next in the field.
